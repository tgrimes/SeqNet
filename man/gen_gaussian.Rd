\title{Generate sample from overdispered Poisson}
\usage{
gen_gaussian(n, network)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of samples to generate.}

\item{network}{The underlying network (from create_network())}
}
\value{
A list containing the n by p matrix of samples, the underlying network,
and an n by p matrix containing mean expression values for each gene on each sample
after incorporating the underlying network.
}
\description{
Generates count data based on the overdispered Poisson distribution.
}
\examples{
n <- 10
# Create a simple small-world network.
network <- create_network(p = 100, modules = list(1:100)) 
# Generate "normalized" expression data from the network:
x <- gen_gaussian(n, network)$x
}
