\title{Connect disconnected components in an adjacency matrix}
\usage{
connect_module_structure(adj, weights = NULL, alpha = 100, beta = 1,
  epsilon = 10^-5)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{An adjacency matrix to modify.}

\item{weights}{(Optional) weights used for sampling nodes.}

\item{epsilon}{A small constant added to the sampling probability of each node.}

\item{eta}{A positive value used for sampling nodes.}
}
\value{
A modified adjacency matrix
}
\description{
Connect disconnected components in an adjacency matrix
}
\note{
When connecting two components, a node is sampled from each with
probability proportional to ecdf(weights)(weights)^eta + epsilon,
where 'weights' are subset to only those nodes in the corresponding component.
When 'eta' = 0, this results in uniform sampling. When 'eta' > 0, 
nodes having larger 'weight' are more likely to be selected, where 'weight'
is equal to 'weights' + degree. (If Arugment 'weights' is NULL, then 'weight'
is simply the node degree).
