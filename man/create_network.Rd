\usage{
create_network(p, n_cliques = NULL, clique_size = NULL, cliques = NULL,
  n_hubs = NULL, hub_size = NULL, hubs = NULL, n_modules = NULL,
  module_size = NULL, modules = NULL, nonoverlapping = FALSE,
  module_neig = 2, module_prob = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The number of nodes in the graph}

\item{n_cliques}{The number of cliques in the graph.}

\item{clique_size}{A vector containing the size of each clique.}

\item{cliques}{A list of vectors, with each vector specifying a
set genes within a clique.}

\item{n_hubs}{The number of hub genes in the graph.}

\item{hub_size}{A vector containing the size (hub degree + 1) of each hub.}

\item{hubs}{A list of vectors, with each vector specifying a set
of hub genes; the first entry in the vector is the hub.}

\item{n_modules}{The number of modules in the graph.}

\item{module_size}{A vector containing the size of each hub.}

\item{modules}{A list of vectors, with each vector specifying a set of
genes within each module.}

\item{nonoverlapping}{If true, cliques and hubs will not share any nodes.}

\item{module_neig}{Used for generating small-world networks for modules; 
specifies the initial degree of each node.}

\item{module_prob}{Used for generating small-world networks for modules; 
specifies the rewiring probability of each initial edges. At 0 the graph is
a lattice ring, and at 1 it is a random graph.}
}
\value{
A network object.
}
\description{
Creates a graph with certain features. This network is then
used with other sample generating methods to obtain count data. Note: the
module structure is used to incorporate general pathways in the graph. These
are randomly constructed by generating a small-world graph using the Watts-Strogatz
method (implemented through igraph::watts.strogatz.game).
}
\examples{
# Create a network with no connections:
create_network(p = 100)
# Create a small-world network using all verticies:
create_network(p = 100, modules = list(1:100))
# Create a network with cliques and hubs:
create_network(p = 100, cliques = list(1:5, 6:10), hubs = list(11:15, 16:25))
