Description: This package provides methods to simulate RNA-seq data from an underlying gene-gene association network. Functions are provided to generate random networksof any size. Network objects are built from individual modules that represent pathways;these modules, which may overlap, are generated to have a small-world network structure. RNA-seq counts can be generated such that the association among gene expression reflect the underlying network. A reference RNA-seq dataset can be provided to model realistic marginal counts. Plotting functions are available to visualize a network, compare two networks, and compare the expression of two genes across multiple networks.
