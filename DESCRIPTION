Title: Generate RNA-seq data from regulatory networks
Version: 0.0.2.0001
Authors@R: person("Tyler", "Grimes", email = "tyler.grimes@ufl.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Contains a function for creating networks by specifying cliques, hubs, 
  and modules. Random, small-world networks can easily be generated by default. 
  A plotting function is also implemented, with an emphasis on having
  comparisons between networks made easy. RNA-seq expression counts are generated by
  passing a network into the generator. Some gene co-expression methods are also
  provided, including correlations, WGCNA, and cPLS.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.2)
